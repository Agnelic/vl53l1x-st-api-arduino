# ST VL53L1X API implementation for Arduino

This is an implementation of ST's [STSW-IMG007][api] VL53L1X API for the Arduino platform, for use with the [Pololu VL53L1X time-of-flight distance sensor carrier][product]. It includes an example sketch adapted from ST's [X-CUBE-53L1A1][exp].

To load the sketch, open the file **vl53l1x-st-api.ino** in the vl53l1x-st-api directory.
